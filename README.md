We bought this E88 Pro drone around year ago. It's so popular drone on market.

After this project I can say more exactly - there are many such identical models.(for example )

Some played with it, but then there was a problem with one of the motors. 
problem with motor - renew - but found that this is prop trouble/ 
Long time drone was inactive in box, but in November in within the framework of the ESP8266 project (repo will be aded) I decided to create own flight controller. 
Studied about developing firmware for drones. On the basis of the war in Ukraine, this research is a small aspect of Milltech It was also a research project and u can see it by link … 

In some moment I decide to use as max as posible from drones that we have at home. 
Firstly it was such - task try to control it by other way then original app and same with geting video.
So first step was searching about reverse engineering such drones. Probably first material was this repo - https://github.com/c0nr3f/E88-Pro-Python  
Here and in some other similiar articles Wireshark wa smentioned.
On that moment I just knew sth about network technologies and most interesting for me there is different network protocols and abbreviation as way to name it/ It’s so cool. For example? just fun case,  u can use such big letters in talk and only some people can understand it 
Despite it the best in network protocols it’s structuring. For it people use 

Also I want mention this repo - https://github.com/FahrulID/reversing-wifi-uav.
This was not first such repo which I saw in this month, but this itself was the driving inspiration to start repository for presenting my RD results. Another reason is that I did not find such materials anywhere that would be similar for these drones in one place. 

 PRACTICE IS THE BEST TEACHER 
so I decide not only describe my rd results as experience, but also put here a lsth like tutorials for some tools (mb)

As min, I during this project get practice expirence about network engeeniring, pentesting, OSINT
(here will be added detailed list)
